# First Portfolio

## Description
The purpose of creating a Portfolio is to establish a general amount of knowledge in a practical setting while supplying a 'home page' of sorts for my projects. 

Comments have been left to show changes done in-detail. By separating each section with comments, it allows the viewer to jump to each section in a streamlined manner. Only one portfolio example is coding-related at the moment, the rest are presented as offsite links.
